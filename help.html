<h1>Pure Javascript Geotagging tool</h1>
<p>The geotagged images can be dragged to the map. They will appear on the map with red pin and cannot be moved.</p>
<p>The images without geotag can be positioned on the map using control keyboard key and moving the mouse over the image. After positioning the image can be saved from the info window.</p>
<p>For both tagged and not tagged images you can click on the image to read all the metadata (EXIF tags) written in the image file.</p>
